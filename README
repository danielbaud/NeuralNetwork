USAGE:
	To create a Neural Network, you have to create a config file (*.conf).
	You can see its structure in skel/
	You can add as many data as you want your network to learn

	Then, just type:
		$ make create
		$ ./create config_file

	When you are done with learning, you can run your network with the input
	wanted. To do so, just type:
		$ make run
		$ ./run network.ann x1 x2 x3 ... xn
		          with xI your inputs
	 	    OR

		$ ./run runfile.rf
	The structure of a runfile is also in skel/


EXAMPLE:

	There is an example of a config file and runfile and usage of the
	program:

	xor.conf	xor.ann
			2
			3
			1
			0
			0 0 0
			0 1 1
			1 0 1
			1 1 0

	xor.rf		xor.ann
			0 0
			0 1
			1 0
			1 1


	$ make create
	$ ./create xor.conf
	0|err0 1|err1 2|err2 3|err3
	0|err0 1|err1 2|err2 3|err3
	0|err0 1|err1 2|err2 3|err3
	Network saved at xor.ann
	$ make run
	$ ./run xor.ann 0 1
	0 1  ->  0.998423
	$ ./run xor.rf
	0 0  ->  0.007253
	0 1  ->  0.993621
	1 0  ->  0.991622
	1 1  ->  0.006273
