USAGE:
	To create a Neural Network, you have to create a config file (*.conf).
	The config file has to be like this:

	"""
	name_of_network.ann
	x1
	x2
	..
	xN
	0
	i1(1) i1(2) ... i1(x1) o1(1) o1(2) ... o1(xN)
	i2(1) i2(2) ... i2(x1) o2(1) o2(2) ... o2(xN)
	....
	iK(1) iK(2) ... iK(x1) oK(1) oK(2) ... oK(xK)
	"""

	x1, x2 ... xN are the number of neurons in each layer, with N being the
	last layer.
	iX(Y) are the input of the first layer and oX(Y) are the outputs to find
	in the last layer when learning.
	You can add as many data as you want your network to learn

	Then, just type:
		$ make create
		$ ./create config_file

	When you are done with learning, you can run your network with the input
	wanted. To do so, just type:
		$ make run
		$ ./run network.ann x1 x2 x3 ... xn
		          with xI your inputs

EXAMPLE:
	there is an example of a config file and usage of the program:

	xor.conf	xor.ann
			2
			3
			1
			0
			0 0 0
			0 1 1
			1 0 1
			1 1 0

	$ make create
	$ ./create xor.conf
	0|err0 1|err1 2|err2 3|err3
	0|err0 1|err1 2|err2 3|err3
	0|err0 1|err1 2|err2 3|err3
	Network saved at xor.ann
	$ make run
	$ ./run xor.ann 0 1
	0.998423
